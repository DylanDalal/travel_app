Passport is a travel application for users to keep track of their past trips, ranking what they liked and didn't, so that they can share it with friends and reference this information in future trips. Passport offers AI trip planning services and direct booking of events, hotels and excursions, all powered by a users' shared data.

# **Feature Requests**

# Core Functionalities
- **Photo and Video Management**
  - Place pins on the map for any media captured on the user's phone (problems will arise with prior phones, etc.).
  - Establish trips based on multiple-day-long photo sessions a certain distance from the user's home.
  - Organize media for each trip stop.
  - Create a map for each trip and an accompanying video, with tools for simple editing and trip curation.
  - Add videos/pictures from uploaded media to trip video.
  
- **Rankings and Reviews**
  - Rank cities based on various factors, i.e. Nightlife, Scenery.
  - Review restaurants and excursions from trips. Look into connecting to GetYourGuide and TripAdvisor APIs to automatically load this info.
  - If a trip was meant for, for example, independent camping and nightsky photography, maybe a person can give a brief synopsis and we can language-process that into a description. That way, when people are looking at trips for the area, they still have the recommendation, but we know that it's been cleaned and professionalized.
  - Rank trips vs trips.
  - Once a trip is fully complete, with reviews and photos, earn a stamp for the location?
 
- **Friend System**
  - Add friends and compare maps/stamps.
  - Postcards?
